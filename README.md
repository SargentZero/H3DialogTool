# H3DialogTool

This tool is written in Python, and was created using ChatGPT and myself. I am currently learning Python myself, and hope this simple tool helps. 
(WIP) This tool currently takes wav files, extracted using Reclaimer or downloaded from https://www.sounds-resource.com, organizes files into folders created from the files names and renames the file to permutation name in brackets[].
